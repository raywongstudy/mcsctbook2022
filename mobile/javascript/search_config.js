It is challenging to build ubiquitous                                 and intelligent 6G systems, handling stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements,                                 providing a rich set of communication modes, including unicast, multicast, broadcast,                                 in-cast, and group-cast, and supporting user-centric mobile applications.

In                                 this talk, we shall provide a general framework to reveal the fundamental tradeoff                                 between sensing and communications (S\&C), where a unified ISAC signal is exploited                                 to perform dual-functional tasks. In particular, we define the Cramér-Rao bound                                 (CRB)-rate region to characterize the S\&C tradeoff, and propose a pentagon inner                                 bound of the region. We show that the two corner points of the CRB-rate region                                 can be achieved by the conventional Gaussian signaling and a novel strategy                                 corresponding to the uniform distribution over the Stiefel manifold, respectively.                                 Moreover, we also offer our insights into transmission approaches achieving the                                 boundary of the CRB-rate region, namely the Shannon-Fisher information flow.","2022              Invited Speakers    Beijing, China            Zhaoming LU              Associate Professor             Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications                                                       Sensing and Communications Track    •  18              Joint Vehicular Localization and Reflective Mapping Based            on Team Channel-SLAM             This talk addresses high-resolution vehicle positioning and tracking. In recent work,            it was shown that a fleet of independent but neighboring vehicles can cooperate            for the task of localization by capitalizing on the existence of common surrounding            reflectors, using the concept of Team Channel-SLAM. This approach exploits an            initial (e.g. GPS-based) vehicle position information and allows subsequent tracking            of vehicles by exploiting the shared nature of virtual transmitters associated to the            reflecting surfaces. In this talk, we show that the localization can be greatly enhanced            by joint sensing and mapping of reflecting surfaces. To this end, we propose a            combined approach coined Team Channel-SLAM Evolution (TCSE) which exploits            the intertwined relation between (i) the position of virtual transmitters, (ii) the shape            of reflecting surfaces, and (iii) the paths described by the radio propagation rays, in            order to achieve high-resolution vehicle localization. Overall, TCSE yields a complete            picture of the trajectories followed by dominant paths together with a mapping            of reflecting surfaces. While joint localization and mapping is a well researched            topic within robotics using inputs such as radar and vision, this paper is first to            demonstrate such an approach within mobile networking framework based on radio            data.

To fulfill such                                 challenging visions, the reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) is developed as                                 a promising solution due to its capability of accurate multi-beam steering with        Sensing and Communications Track    •   19                                 low power consumption and hardware cost. Unlike the conventional phase-                                 controlled antennas, RHS can control the radiation amplitude of the reference                                 wave propagating on the metasurface by leveraging the holographic technique.

Considering limited computing            and communication resources, it is important to select appropriate clients from a            huge number of users to participate in the training process. The problem of choosing            proper clients is particularly complex due to the heterogeneity of network users,            including the differences in the data, computation capability, available throughput,            and samples freshness. This talk introduces a fuzzy logic based client selection            scheme to address this issue. The scheme considers the number of local samples,            samples freshness, computation capability, and available network throughput            based on a fuzzy logic approach. Extensive evaluation results show that the scheme            outperforms existing baselines.

Environmental            sustainability issues have been important topics for recent years, which has impacted            and will further impact individuals, enterprises, governments, and societies.            Environmental sustainability is not simply regarding reducing the amount of waste            or using less energy, but relevant to developing processes leading to completely            sustainable human society in the future. The long term consequences of the relevant            serious issues have not yet been fully forecasted, but it has been generally accepted            in many communities that immediate responses are necessary. From 30 November            to 12 December 2015, the 21th United Nations Climate Change Conferences of            the Parties (COP 21) was held in Paris, France, as the a historical breakthrough and            milestone towards securing the future Earth, a global agreement on the reduction            of climate change, the text of which represented a consensus of the representatives            of more than 193 countries attending it, which was a profound milestone for global            environmental sustainability. Nowadays there is another significant tendency on data            driven intelligence. This talk would discuss the history, technical issues, challenges,            and new trends of data driven environmental sustainability and Intelligence.

As one of the key                                 paradigms of distributed ML, Federated learning (FL) allows a group of end-devices                                 to report their locally trained models to a central parameter-server for aggregating        Sensing and Communications Track    •   21                                 the global model, instead of directly sending the raw data to the central parameter-                                 server, which thus brings the advantages of preserving the data privacy of the end-                                 devices as well as saving the bandwidth consumption for delivering the raw data to                                 the parameter-server. However, periodically executing the local model training as                                 well as reporting the trained model-data to the parameter-server result in significant                                 energy consumption to end-devices which usually suffer from limited energy                                 capacities. To address this challenging issue, this talk will focus on the discussions on                                 the design of green Federated Learning.

They need to accomplish two different types of tasks, and they             are studied by two different sets of domain experts. Machine learning is the task             of extracting a model from the data, while optimization is to find the optimal             solutions from the learned model. In the current era of big data and AI, however,             such separation may hurt the end-to-end performance from data to optimization             in unexpected ways --- a recent result shows a fundamental limitation that directly             optimizing from data samples is not achievable even when the separate model             learning and model-driven optimization can be effectively executed. In this talk,             I will introduce an approach called optimization from structured samples (OPSS)             to tightly integrate learning and optimization by carefully utilizing the structural             information from the sample data to adjust the learning and optimization algorithms.             In particular, I will show how to overcome the above limitation when maximizing the             (stochastic) coverage functions from structured data samples even when a model             cannot be accurately learned from the data. OPSS is an effective approach for the             paradigm of data-driven optimization, and it has applications in online advertising,             influence maximization and other data-driven optimization tasks.","2022                                                           Invited Speakers     Fribourg                                                         Philippe Cudré-Mauroux                                                           Professor                                                         University of Fribourg                                   Software Systems for Heterogeneous Hardware        AI and Big Data Track    •  23                                 and Advanced Data Processing Platforms                                 Many large computer clusters offer alternative computing elements in addition to                                 general-purpose CPUs. GPU and FPGAs are very common choices. Two emerging                                 technologies can further widen the options in that context: in-network computing                                 (INC) and near-storage processing (NSP). These technologies support computing                                 over data that is in transit between nodes or inside the storage stack, respectively.                                 There are several advantages to moving computations to INC and NSP platforms.                                 Notably, the original computation path does not need to be altered to route data                                 through these subsystems; the network and the storage are naturally present in                                 most computations. In this talk, I will describe the evolutionary steps that led to INC                                 and NSP platforms and discuss how they can improve critical computing paths in                                 large-scale data-intensive systems.

End-            user can use mobile devices to scan and decode the QR code, and then verify the            authenticity of products through an online anti-counterfeiting system. However,            there is serve flaw in such a QR code-based anti-counterfeiting solution. The genuine            QR code can be physically replicated by scanning and printing. Considering that the            authentic QR code is printed and published, the malicious counterfeiter can easily            scan, restore, and replicate a counterfeit QR code, which can pass the authentication            as well. This physically illegal copying attack violates the unique QR code for one            item principle and poses great threats to the QR code based anti-counterfeiting.            In this talk, we present a physical anti-copying semi-robust watermarking system            for QR codes.  Specifically, the authentic and counterfeit channels that a QR code            experiences were investigated. By exploiting the distortion characteristics between            the authentic and counterfeit channels, a semi-robust watermark embedding system            was devised, where the watermark bit is embedded by modulating the relationship            between two carefully selected transformed coefficients. Finally, to obtain a valid and            recognizable binary QR code image, a random binarization procedure was applied.            The final resultant watermark appears as white-dot pattern resides the black module            of the QR code, which is robust to the authentic print-scan but fragile to physically            illegal copying. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed            watermarking system. This work made the first step towards exploring semi-robust            watermarking for combating physically illegal copying.","2022                                                                    Invited Speakers     Hong Kong, China                                                                  Chao HUANG                                                                   Assistant Professor                                                                  University of Hong Kong                                    Self-supervised Recommender Systems        AI and Big Data Track    •  25                                 Recommender systems are playing an increasingly critical role to alleviate information                                 overload and satisfy users' information seeking requirements in a wide spectrum                                 of online platforms.

Regardless of the documented            effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the disease, as per statistics given by            the World Health Organization (WHO), the worldwide vaccination rate at present            is still far from ideal. To boost the vaccine uptake, understanding people’s stances            towards COVID-19 vaccination might be the primary considerations. Various popular            online social platforms have gathered a colossal amount of user data related to the            pandemic, including user-generated contents and user interactions representing            the written expressions of users and the user-to-user interactivity, respectively. These            data can potentially be exploited to learn user stances. Compared with the traditional            methods like surveys and polls, understanding people's stances based on the data            of online social platforms has the advantages of real-time, multiple information            sources, and lower cost. In practice, while we can obtain user stances explicitly            expressed in user-generated contents, there are some users who prefer not to reveal            their stances in these contents. For these users, their stances are usually embedded            in their interactions with other users. In this talk, we present a large-scale and novel            dataset that consists of an interaction graph of COVID-19 vaccination stances based            on the Twitter user data we collect. In addition, we investigate an application of            the proposed dataset, the task of which is detecting user stances based on the            interaction graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to study the problem            of automatic COVID-19 stance detection based on the interaction graph. We believe            that our research can help corresponding entities make better use of the online social            platform data to estimate and understand the real-time trend of the public stances            towards vaccination, and then formulate relevant policies to overcome vaccine            hesitancy. The arduous race to increase vaccine uptake could benefit from such            understanding.","2022                                                                    Invited Speakers     Shanghai, China                                                                  Zhihao TANG                                                                   Associate Professor                                                                  Shanghai University of Finance and Economics                                    Order Selection Prophet Inequality        AI and Big Data Track    •  27                                 In the classical prophet inequality, a gambler faces a sequence of items, whose                                 values are drawn independently from known distributions. Upon the arrival of each                                 an item, its value is realized and the gambler either accepts it and the game ends,                                 or irrevocably rejects it and continues to the next item. The goal is to maximize the                                 value of the selected item and compete against the expected maximum value of all                                 items. A tight competitive ratio of 21 is established in the classical setting and various                                 relaxations have been proposed to surpass the barrier, including the i.i.d. model, the                                 order selection model, and the random order model.                                 In this paper, we advance the study of the order selection prophet inequality, in                                 which the gambler is given the extra power for selecting the arrival order of the                                 items. Our main result is a 0.725-competitive algorithm, that substantially improves                                 the state-of-the-art 0.669 ratio by Correa, Saona and Ziliotto (Math. Program. 2021),                                 achieved in the harder random order model. Recently, Agrawal, Sethuraman and                                 Zhang (EC 2020) Xiao, Liu and Huang (AAMAS 2020) proved that the task of selecting                                 the optimal order is NP-hard. Despite this fact, we introduce a novel algorithm design                                 framework that translates the discrete order selection problem into a continuous                                 arrival time design problem. From this perspective, we can focus on the arrival time                                 design without worrying about the threshold optimization afterwards. As a side                                 result, we achieve the optimal 0.745 competitive ratio by applying our algorithm to                                 the i.i.d. model.","2022              Invited Speakers      Macau, China            Xiaowei WU                                                                                               AI and Big Data Track    •  28              Assistant Professor            University of Macau              Recent Developments in Fair Allocations            of Indivisible Chores             In this talk I will introduce some of the recent developments for the computation            and approximation of fair allocation problem for indivisible chores, which is within            the centre of computational social choice and algorithmic game theory.

By participating in an energy community,            prosumers may take a leading role in the energy transition and improve the self-            consumption of renewable energy produced inside the community. Prosumers can            carry out energy exchanges inside the energy community and provide ancillary            services to the system operators, thus contributing to improve the efficiency and            stability of the grid.            A novel scalable, privacy-preserving, and real-time distributed parallel optimization            is proposed to manage a large-scale energy community, considering energy            exchanges inside the community according to the model of virtual self-consumption            and the provision of ancillary services. The proposed method preserves the privacy            of prosumers and allows the assessment of the impact of energy exchanges on the            ancillary services provided by an energy community. Simulation results confirmed            that the proposed method is superior in terms of privacy if compared with the            equivalent centralized optimization and that it has a convergence rate higher than            that of the splitting conic solver (SCS).

As DC power conversion equipment will be the core                                 and foundation of future DC power grids, their designs based on specific application                                 scenarios are vital to satisfy the needs of different nodes within the DC grid.

Transportation system is a critical component of our cities and is generating more            and more data. To leverage the power of the increasing amount of data from traffic            sensors, researchers have started exploring the feasibility of edge computing for            traffic big data analytics. Given the resource constraints on edge devices, it is very            challenging to achieve high intelligence and real-time capability at the same time.            There are few edge transportation systems that function in a multi-tasking mode            with high efficiency and intelligence on the edge. In this talk, we introduce a multi-            thread parallel edge system architecture and several lightweight algorithms for traffic            and road surveillance. The designs ensure robustness and real-time capability for the            key modules of the system.

Cooperative path            planning is one of the most fundamental problems for large-scale mobile robot            groups. How to achieve efficient and collision-free path planning of thousand-robot            teams, and in the meantime, achieving robustness to communication and motion            uncertainties, are the most challenging issues in real applications. In this presentation,            the speaker will report his work on the topic of cooperative path planning of            large-scale mobile robot groups, including hierarchical path planning and motion            coordination framework, integrated optimization approach of task assignment and            path planning, and robust planning strategy in the presence of communication and            motion uncertainties. In addition,  the speaker will also report some extension works            on the reinforcement learning enhanced approaches for multi-robot autonomous            navigation.","2022                                                                   Invited Speakers    Hong Kong, China                                                                 Jieming SHI                                                                   Assistant Professor                                                                 The Hong Kong Polytechnic University                                    Effective Network Embedding Methods                                 on Large-scale Graphs                                  Graph data are everywhere and important in many industrial applications, such                                 as social network recommendation. To support the urgent needs from real-world                                 applications, there are many Network Embedding methods developed in recent        Intelligent Transportation Track    •   35                                 years. However, there is still a crucial challenge largely remaining unsolved: graphs                                 are growing with large volume, usually with hundreds of millions or billions of nodes                                 and edges, making current methods inefficient to handle such large-scale data.                                 It is infeasible to put unlimited computation resources and wait for long time to                                 get high-quality embedding results. We aim to develop new network embedding                                 methods that can handle large-scale graph data with limited resources, and still                                 achieve state-of-the-art quality. In this talk, we will introduce our recent network                                 embedding studies on homogeneous graphs, attributed graphs.

However, the lack of a unified framework for evaluating experiments                                 makes it difficult to determine whether the performance improvement of traffic                                 prediction models is a genuine technical advancement or caused by tuning                                 techniques or dataset differences. To address this problem, we propose LibCity, a                                 scalable, unified open-source traffic prediction evaluation platform that provides                                 researchers with a credible tool for comparative experiments and a convenient tool                                 for model development. In LibCity, we currently cover 9 traffic prediction tasks, 65                                 baseline models and integrate 35 spatiotemporal datasets for researchers to conduct                                 comprehensive evaluation experiments. In addition, researchers can easily develop                                 new models based on LibCity, which means that researchers can easily compare new                                 models with models reproduced in the library. Thanks to this, LibCity will significantly                                 contribute to the standardization and rapid development of the field of traffic                                 prediction. LibCity has been open-sourced on GitHub and has been used in practice                                 by more than 50 organizations worldwide, receiving 400+ stars.

However, the transparency of blockchain networks and the open            mechanism of DeFi applications also cause new security issues. In this talk, we focus            on sandwich attacks, where attackers take advantage of the transaction confirmation            delay and cause financial losses for victims. We evaluate the impact and investigate            users' perceptions of sandwich attacks through a mix-method study. We find that            due to users' lack of technical background and insufficient notifications from the            markets, many users were not aware of the existence and the impact of sandwich            attacks. They also had a limited understanding of how to resolve the security issue.            Interestingly, users showed high tolerance for the impact of sandwich attacks on            individuals and the ecosystem, despite potential financial losses. We discuss general            implications for users, DeFi applications, and the community.

In order to solve these issues, a decoupling causal        Intelligent Transportation Track    •  37                                 learning method is proposed. Based on the decoupling of causal relationship and                                 parameters, a reliable causal relationship of the model is realized, so as to improve                                 the reliability and robustness of the machine learning method. In implantation, a                                 CoGradient descent algorithm is proposed for decoupling causal learning by taking                                 bilinear model as an example.

However, bridging the behavior gap between the simulated and             actual worlds remains to be a challenge. This talk presents a learning-based method             for traffic agent simulation. This learning-based method facilitates two important             properties of traffic simulation for autonomous vehicle (AV) development: realistic             and reactive, where the former means simulated agents’ behavior should match             log-replayed ones in standard conditions, and the latter means simulated agents             should react to the behavioral variations of AVs and other agents in the same way             drivers would do on the road. To achieve this, we learn data-driven agents model             in an end-to-end fashion based on real-world driving data with detailed interaction             information and high-definition maps (HD Maps). For each agent in a driving             scenario, we build an agent-centric multi-channel image to capture its current and             historical interactions with other agents, road elements, and traffic control devices. A             convolutional neural network is then used to extract features from the raster image             and predict the agent's future trajectory through supervised learning. The observed             future 6-second trajectory with a 2 Hz sampling rate is used for training. At inference             time, we do closed-loop simulation by looping between updating agents' positions             and orientations with the predictions from the agent model and generating new             predictions based on updated simulation states. We train and evaluate our models             with hundreds of hours of real-world driving data collected by a fleet of level-5             AVs.

In order to form a                                 debris-flow mitigation strategy, a susceptibility map in response to precipitation                                 and temperature change is urgent. Additionally, the estimation of the economic                                 vulnerability of building at risk is also essential since vulnerability is the key                                 component of quantitative risk assessment. Therefore, in this presentation, a hybrid                                 machine learning model, certainty factor - genetic algorithm - support vector                                 classification (CF-GA-SVM), will be introduced firstly to map the catchment-based                                 susceptibility of glacier-related debris flows. Eleven causative factors were selected to        Urban Public Safety and Disaster Prevention Track    •  39                                 generate a susceptibility map. The receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) and                                 prediction accuracy (ACC) were used to evaluate the model performance. Then, the                                 catchments with high susceptibility levels were extracted to predict the economic                                 vulnerability (Ve) of buildings to future glacier-related debris flows. The economic                                 vulnerability relies on the calculation of impact pressure to buildings, and the impact                                 pressure is decided based on the predicted debris-flow volume by using a machine                                 learning algorithm, XGBoost. A total of 60 debris-flow events were identified to train                                 and test the prediction model based on the selection of four geomorphic factors.                                 The prediction results were validated by Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The                                 studies showed that the CF-GA-SVM model achieved AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.945                                 and ACC of 0.800, respectively. The maximum impact pressure on buildings by future                                 glacier-related debris flows reached 67.3kPa and the lowest impact pressure was                                 only 6.3kPa. As for the economic vulnerability of buildings, the maximum economic                                 vulnerability was found to be 143.41 €/m2 and the minimum value lowered to 0.19 €/                                 m2.","2022              Invited Speakers    Hangzhou, China            Zhiguo HE              Professor            Zhejiang University               Fast and Maneuverable Soft Robots             Driven by Underwater Combustion                                                                         Urban Public Safety and Disaster Prevention Track    •  40             Exploration in complicated and unpredictable underwater environments, especially            deep sea, require highly flexible and adjustable devices. Soft robots have been            extensively reported in many fields, and provide a possible option due to their            potential to be fast, accurate and tunable for multifunctional applications. However,            the implementation of their rapid turn and acceleration underwater is still a            challenge. This leads to an urgent need for rapid response with good controllability,            especially for those underwater applications. In this study, we develop, and            quantitatively assess, combustion-driven soft robots with programmable underwater            locomotion. The soft robots are designed with gas chambers that are inflated            with oxygen-to-propane mixed gas and sealed by ultra-expandable silicon rubber            membranes. Combustion of the mixed gas expands the membranes to propel            water. Adjusting the location and amount of gas for combustion, the soft robots            demonstrate programmable motions. The kinematic performance of the soft robot            can achieve 1.2 body length in 300 ms. The acceleration and performance of the soft            robots are confirmed by our experimental measurements, theoretical analyses, and            numerical simulations.

It is difficult to obtain entire monitoring data in the accelerated                                 deformation phase in a landslide event, and hard to issue early warning information                                 using a traditional monitoring approach with fixed and low sampling frequency.                                 Displacement increments of loess landslides induced by agriculture irrigation on                                 the Heifangtai terrace could be sudden and extremely rapid. Typical landslide types                                 include loess flowslides and loess falls.

The monitoring technique can wirelessly transmit                                 displacement data and the LEWS was devised using the new artificial intelligence.                                 The LEWS could automatically release the warning information in advance of the                                 event once the early warning parameters exceed default thresholds.

By using automatic unman vehicles (AUVs), we investigate the responses of            sea surface temperature, and the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration to TCs within            an anticyclone in the northern South China Sea. DO concentrations have a higher            value at the edge of eddy than at the core. Influenced by TC, DO concentrations            decrease remarkably in the subsurface layer in all three regions (inside, edge, and            outside of the anticyclonic eddy). The mean DO concentrations decrease more at the            edge of the anticyclone than those inside the anticyclone. The recovery time of DO            concentration after TC is around one week at the edge of the anticyclone and is >10            days within the eddy. Our observations show that the DO concentrations decrease            above the subsurface chlorophyll a maxima layer. Quantitative analysis shows that            variations in DO concentration are dominated by horizontal advection and vertical            advection terms in the subsurface layer.

This study aims at developing a key part of digital twin technology by making full             use of the Bayesian model updating to account for multiple uncertainties such as             measurement noise and model error properly. Bayesian nonparametric modelling             technique that provides a surrogate mapping between the probability spaces of the             model parameters and the theoretical responses are employed to replace a large             number of time-consuming finite element simulations required in the likelihood             evaluations by very fast approximate estimates. The transitional Monte Carlo Markov             Chain in conjunction with the metamodel is used to sample the posterior probability             density function of the updated parameters at a very reasonable cost. Furthermore,             a distributed parallel computing scheme was utilized to allow the TMCMC stochastic             simulation to run across multiple CPU cores. Several case studies with field test data             are used to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

However, damaged buildings are                                 often demolished after earthquakes because too large residual deformation makes                                 repair economically unviable. As a high-performance metallic material, superelastic                                 shape memory alloys (SMAs) are appealing to the earthquake engineering                                 community because their flag-shaped hysteresis can minimize post-earthquake                                 residual deformation and enhance structural repairability. This presentation will                                 highlight the research on seismic applications of superelastic SMAs, from material,                                 structural member, to structural system levels.

We put forth an            online learning technique, referred to as integrated Deep Reinforcement learning and            stable Matching (DeepRM), in the sense that the MCS adaptation and RB allocation            decisions are conducted without acquiring the real-time channel quality indicator            (CQI) feedback. DeepRM is a closed-loop framework, where the output of deep            reinforcement learning (DRL) is imported into the stable matching to guide optimal            RB allocation whilst the output of stable matching is fed into the DRL framework to            assist efficient MCS decision-making.  Simulation results demonstrate that compared            with ACO-HM, OLLA-ADA, and ARBDQ-Random algorithms, DeepRM induces much            less RB consumption while guaranteeing the QoS requirements of all UEs in various            network scenarios.

However, a common challenge and criticism of ML for geotechnical modelling is            a lack of interpretability and onerous dependency on big data. This study presents            an interpretable data-driven constitutive modelling approach for application in            the context of sparse geotechnical data. Improved interpretability is achieved by            incorporating (a) ‘multi-fidelity’ strategy, (b) physics constraints and (c) uncertainty            within the predictions.","2022                                                                     Invited Speakers    Guangzhou, China                                                                  Junbo ZHANG                                                                   Professor                                                                  South China University of Technology                                    Challenges of Digitizing Power Grid Operation                                 Business and a Brief Discussion on the Bottleneck                                 of the Digital Platform’s Data Lake                                  The digitization of operation business is the core for constructing a digital power                                 grid.
